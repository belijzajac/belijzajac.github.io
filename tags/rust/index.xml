It focuses on delivering tiny Linux binaries (ELF x86_64) with no LLVM dependency. As a result, what it actually competes with is the LLVM toolchain, on which a large number of other programming languages rely extensively.
The reason for focusing on the delivery of small binaries with no LLVM dependency is to offer an alternative to the LLVM toolchain.</description></item><item><title>Outperforming Rayon with OpenMP</title><link>https://belijzajac.dev/outperforming-rayon-with-openmp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 12:43:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://belijzajac.dev/outperforming-rayon-with-openmp/</guid><description>Whatâ€™s it all about? For the Blockchain Technologies course, students were paired into groups and assigned to produce the fastest Rust library (crate) implementing the KZG10 scheme. Two teams used the same backend, that is, blst (implemented in assembly with direct bindings for Rust and C). The first team, blst-from-scratch, was using the said Rust bindings to produce an interface closer to c-kzg, whereas the ckzg team, which I was part of, was responsible for porting the latter over to Rust.</description></item></channel></rss>
